As part of [DataVis](http://datavis.caltech.edu), Caltech has partnered with JPL and the ArtCenter College of Design to bring together software engineers and artists to build an interactive data visualisation tool, consulted by and build exclusively for CliMA's scientists and developers ([code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xFlVKunny2ZIgg_xFn7vgIWZko151zwG/view?usp=sharing), please ask a CliMA member for access).

The current implementation offers a lightweight interactive visualization and manipulation of data from CliMA's atmospheric large eddy simulation (AtmosLES) for local modeling of turbulence and clouds.
