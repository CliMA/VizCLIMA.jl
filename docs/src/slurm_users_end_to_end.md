# End-to-end modelling

These examples run the model and output the visualisations/performance metrics using one script. They are aimed at users of the Caltech's HPC cluster users, but can be easily modified for other systems.  

## Scripts

- [Run LES experiment and plot some output](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl/wiki/Bash-Run-Scripts)
- [Set up multi-experiment GCM runs with performance info tracking on GPU](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl/wiki/Bash-Run-Scripts#step-by-step)

## Demos

- [Basic GCM: run and plot](https://lenkanovak.github.io/_pages/visualisation/demo_basic_gcm/)
- [Output and plot the last timestep before crashing](https://lenkanovak.github.io/_pages/visualisation/demo_debug_gcm/)
- [Run multiple experiments and plot their differences](https://lenkanovak.github.io/_pages/visualisation/demo_basic_multi_gcm/)

NB: these demos are based on the ClimateMachine.jl v0.2 release.
